# 🛠️ My Personal Bash Aliases

This repository is a collection of my personal Bash aliases and functions that help streamline my development workflow. It starts with a simple but powerful alias for Git commits and pushes.

## 🚀 Alias: `gcp`

The `gcp` function allows me to quickly commit and push changes to GitHub with a formatted message. It supports commit types like `feat` and `bugfix`, and lets me write custom messages on the fly.

### 📄 Usage

```bash
gcp feat "add login functionality"
gcp bugfix "fix null pointer exception"
```
