# 🛠️ My Personal Bash Aliases

This repository is a collection of my personal Bash aliases and functions that help streamline my development workflow. It starts with a simple but powerful alias for Git commits and pushes.

## 🚀 Alias: `gcp`

The `gcp` function allows me to quickly commit and push changes to GitHub with a formatted message. It supports commit types like `feat` and `bugfix`, and lets me write custom messages on the fly.

### 📄 Usage

```bash
gcp feat "add login functionality"
gcp bugfix "fix null pointer exception"
```

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

This is the first personal alias I’ve created and decided to keep. As I continue to refine my workflow and discover other useful aliases, I’ll be uploading them here gradually.

## 🗂️ Future Plans

- Add aliases for Docker, Python, and system utilities

- Include setup instructions for sourcing these aliases

- Share tips and tricks for shell productivity

Stay tuned!
